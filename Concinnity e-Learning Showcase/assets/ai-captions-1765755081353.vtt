Learning to me is living,

1
00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:06.420
because if you're alive,

2
00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:07.840
you want to know more.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.649
Learning to me is really important.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.970
Discovering something new,

5
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.869
enjoyable.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.670
Gaining knowledge,

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.770
understanding the kind of opportunities around us.

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.010
So learning means to me is getting new knowledge and then practically using it.

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.290
Learning is for everyone,

10
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.850
everywhere.

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.329
Learning is an investment in your future.

12
00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.540
For me,

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.240
learning is ongoing.

14
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.099
You don't learn,

15
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.720
you don't live.

16
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.650
I believe learning,

17
00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.180
it's an everyday mission.

18
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.319
It's a constant improvement of yourself,

19
00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:42.319
of how you

20
00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.419
become a better person and how do you become

21
00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.720
more contribute to this community and to the society

22
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.430
by actively learning every single day.
